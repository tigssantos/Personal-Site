				<p class="text-left text-black u-fs-22 u-lh-1_7">I'm a business owner from Boston, MA. I work as a freelance marketing manager for small businesses as a side job.</p>

				<p>Your business can be doing so much better than it already is. We're living in the age of the internet where any business at any size that utilizes the internet properly to atract more customers will generate far more revenue than competitors. I've noticed that even though this hs been proven time and time again, many small businesses haven't taken advantage of this golden opportunity. With technology advancing at such a rapid pace, many businesses will have to adapt. That's why I'm working to help businesses grow and stay relevant in this day and age.</p>
